title: How can I handle long GET queries?
order: 70

<p>GET queries are very useful for testing quickly from the browser, but with multiple parameters they can get unmanageably long. Some browsers have a limit on GET query length (at 2048 characters) and they become very difficult to read.</p>

<p>It is recommended to treat more complex queries as POST requests, use the <a href="/parameters#verbose">verbose</a> parameter to get the query in JSON syntax and paste it into any of the POST examples in this documentation for quick tests (checking the resource is correct in the url). (See also <a href="#get-to-post">How do I convert GET requests to POST requests?</a>. Also note that the  <a href="https://reliefweb.github.io/search-converter">search converter</a> tool generates GET and POST queries from searches on ReliefWeb.</p>
