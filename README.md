#RWAPI Documentation

Hosted on Github pages.

For local development, build with Jekyll. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

Changes to fields-tables.html can be made on the spreadsheet at
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/194BA3jUqbVi3cnQF0NiFhZ7xn3kyDAduLKk0NC_CgeQ
and copied into the marked area in that file.

CSS files are concatenated from the list in _css_files.txt. To make any changes, run `./css-concatenator.sh` after updating the files or the file file-list.
TODO: looking for a better way to do this.
