## Getting Started using the ReliefWeb API

The ReliefWeb API was originally designed internally to help power a mobile web view of the [Reliefweb.int](http://Reliefweb.int) website.  It has since been developed to allow for the public to access and make use of ReliefWeb data programatically.  

This first 1.0 release of the API has been designed to allow for easy self discovery of data and hierarchy via a self documenting API structure.  API reference documentation has been published using SWAGGER, a tool that allows you to experiment and explore how various API calls work directly within the documentation.  The API has also been designed to allow for future augmentation and improvement once we'e heard your feedback and ideas for improvement!
