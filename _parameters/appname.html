<p><em>(string)</em> This parameter allows ReliefWeb to monitor API usage and adapt it to user needs.</p>

<p>Please use your website url if you have one or an email address where we can contact you. All of the examples in this documentation use <code>apidoc</code> but if you copy and paste examples into your own applications, we ask you to change it.</p>

<p>Note that for both GET and POST requests, the <code>appname</code> parameter is sent in the url.</p>

<p>If you rely on the API, do let us know through the <a href="https://reliefweb.int/contact">contact</a> form, so we can keep you informed of any changes.</p>
