<p>The ReliefWeb API was built to power a <a href="https://m.reliefweb.int">mobile/ low-bandwidth version</a> of the ReliefWeb website. Since then it has been enhanced for a public release to provide access to ReliefWeb's curated and continuously updated data archive. It's now used to serve much of the main site, selected content on other OCHA sites, and third party apps.</p>

<p>All the content of ReliefWeb is available through its API. The API is built to fit with current API best-practices, and is intended to be friendly to developers, as well as machines. It is publicly accessible using HTTP requests and returns JSON data.</p>

<p>Understanding the structure of ReliefWeb's content will help in understanding how the API works, so these documents are intended to make both as clear as possible. For clarification or to suggest improvements, please <a href="https://reliefweb.int/contact">contact</a> us.</p>
