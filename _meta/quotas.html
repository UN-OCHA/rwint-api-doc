<p>In order to ensure optimum performance for everyone, the API is restricted in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The maximum number of entries returned per call is 1000.</li>
  <li>The maximum number of calls allowed per day is 1000.</li>
</ul>

<p>We feel that these limitations are reasonable and should not interfere with most applications. If they cause significant problems for your use case, please <a href="https://reliefweb.int/contact">let us know</a> and we will review on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>ReliefWeb does not guarantee the accuracy of its data and is not responsible for any damages resulting from the use of API. There are no fees associated with the use of ReliefWeb API.</p>

<p>Changes to the Terms of Service will be announced on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rw-api-dev">API support forum</a>.</p>
