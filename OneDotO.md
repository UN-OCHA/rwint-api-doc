## Landing Page
 The Landing page should be approached as an orientation and marketing page that helps give context to the API.  The desire here is to help quickly educate potential users of the API about it’s background and what it provides as well as show them that there are mechanisms that will allow for the easy learning and use of the API.  The page should also allow more experienced or advanced users to quickly dive into the “deeper” technical documentation and reference material, both to assist in actual development as well as build confidence in the API’s support and maturity. 
 
**Important content that should live on this page includes:**
- Who is Relief Web and what is the website’s mission
Maximum of two paragraphs, can include links to other pages with more detail.
- Why does this API exist
- Mission statement for the API, what success for ReliefWeb looks like when others are consuming the API (1 Paragraph)
- What data is available via the API
- Should be a high level overview, one or two paragraphs
- Statistics about the Data
- The frequency with which it’s updated
- How “far back” the data goes
- Any important facts about what is included or excluded from the dataset currently. (I.E. we were unable to include data about efforts in Australia due to unforseen factor X)
- The expected “usage” of the API
-- Terms of service – Anything not allowed such as reselling the data
-- Rate limit for api requests --- How many api calls per day are we expecting
-- The expected uptime for the API
- Privacy expectations for people using the API
- Any fees / costs associated for access to the API  (We assume none, but good to get this on the record as policy.)
